		<h3>Full Course Description</h3>
		<p>The following description is for informational purposes only and is not an accurate guide to be used for navigation. Any person who uses this to find their way around the course does so at their own risk. The race course will be well-marked with ribbons on race day.</p>
		<p>Start at Belcarra Regional Park, Sasamat Lake, White Pine Beach, Parking Lot A. Head north out of Parking Lot A on the road, winding past the parking areas. After a short distance on the pavement, make a right turn through the yellow gate onto the wide dog-walking trail. Follow this trail as it winds around Sasamat Lake, which will be on your left side. About halfway around the lake, you approach a bridge across the lake. DO NOT CROSS THE BRIDGE. Instead, bear right up to the road. Run on the paved shoulder, bearing left around the corner, then up the hill. Turn onto the entrance road to Belcarra Regional  Park, run along the road and then right onto the trail through Gate WP1 toward Buntzen Ridge. Follow this trail up, up, up. Just after the first view on your left of the Vancouver area, bear left on the trail. Follow the trail around the S curve to the Saddle, which is the location of <span>Aid Station #1</span>.</p>
		<p>At the AS, turn left and up onto the Diez Vista Trail. Follow the ridge past the view points. After a rooty, rocky, trail up and then a very steep down hill, you will arrive on a gravel road. Turn right. In a short distance, turn left onto the Old Buntzen Trail. Again you end up on to a service road. Turn right on the road, cross the bridge over the big pipe and through a gate. In a short distance, you arrive at <span>Aid Station #2</span>.</p>
		<p>Continue along the gravel road, with the lake on your right, to Buntzen North Beach. Cross the suspension bridge and bear left, with the lake now on your left. Follow the Buntzen Lake Trail until you arrive at Pumphouse Road. Follow this gravel road until you can turn left onto the berm and the floating bridge which crosses the lake. Once across the lake, bear left. Follow the trail, turning left at the only intersection. Turn left again onto the Energy Trail. After 200m, turn right, still on the Energy Trail, and then left again in another 100m, still on the Energy Trail. Climb up, over and down the knoll, ending up at the Buntzen South Beach gazebo, <span>Aid Station #3</span>.</p>
		<p>From AS#3, run across the lawn, past the washroom buildings and reconnect to the Buntzen Lake Trail along the east side of the lake, heading north. When you will exit the trail at a gravel road, make a hair-pin right turn up onto the gravel road. Later on, turn left at the Academy Trail. Follow Academy until you arrive at the Equestrian Parking Lot, <span>Aid Station #4.</span></p>
		<p>Continue along the Academy Trail. Turn left at the Horner's Corner 3-way junction onto the Eagle Bluff Trail, climbing up to a fork in the trail just before a small bridge. Bear left here and continue up to the powerline. Turn right, south, at the powerline and follow it all the way to the end at Eagle Mountain Drive. Note &#8211; just after passing a BC Rail bridge, bear left out onto the road to <span>Aid Station #5</span></p>
		<p>From AS#5, turn around and retrace your foot steps all the way back to the Academy Trail. At the Horner&#8217;s Corner 3-way junction, turn left, back onto Academy Trail. Carefully cross the park service road and the Buntzen Lake Parkway road. The trail ends at Pumphouse Road, a gravel service road. Turn right and follow it down to <span>Aid Station #6</span>.</p>
		<p>From AS #6, turn left into the trail and head up the Diez Vista Trail, known affectionately as FYG Hill for reasons you will understand as you climb it on tired legs. As you crest the top of the climb, you will be back at the AS#1 junction. Turn left and follow this trail &emdash; the same one you climbed hours earlier &emdash; until you exit at Gate WP1. Turn left, carefully cross the Belcarra Regional Park Road, and turn right down the stairs. Once down at Sasamat Lake, turn right at the bridge. DO NOT CROSS THE BRIDGE. Follow the lakeside trail until you reach a set of stairs leading up from the lake. Turn right, up the stairs to the finish line.</p>
		<p>Congratulations you finished, about 6000 feet up and 6000 feet down over 50km distance.</p>

	<h1>Volunteers</h1>
		<p>We are very proud of our committed volunteers. Many volunteers have been involved in this run since its inception 20 years ago! Some volunteers will be on the course longer than the runners. Without volunteers, this run would not exist. <span>Be very kind to them!! </span>If you would like to join our volunteer squad, volunteer registration will open in December.</p>

<section id="spectators">
	<h1 class="entry-title">Spectator Info</h1>
		<p>Spectators can access aid station #3 and #4 easily and, of course, the start/finish at Sasamat Lake. Aid stations #1, #2 and #6 are accessible to spectators but only if you park in a parking lot and hike in to them. Please note that runners may accept outside aid or assistance from spectators, but only within the boundaries of an aid station. Do not risk a DNF for your runner!</p>
		<p>The attached link to the Buntzen Lake Rec map brochure shows all the roads and trails in the area.</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.bchydro.com/content/dam/hydro/medialib/internet/documents/community/pdf/buntzen_lake_trails.pdf">http://www.bchydro.com/content/dam/hydro/medialib/internet/documents/community/pdf/buntzen_lake_trails.pdf</a></p>
		<p>The small blue map on page one of the brochure shows how to get to the Buntzen Lake Park from Lougheed/Hwy 7. If you study the main map inset, you will see the main parking area. The beach area nearby has a &#8220;picnic shelter&#8221;. This is <span>aid station #3</span> (23km for runners). Runners will be coming through here from 9:25am until 12:00pm.</p>
		<p>After you see your runner there, you can simply drive a little way back along the park road (~ 2km) to the &#8216;equestrian staging area&#8217; parking lot which is the location of <span>aid station #4</span> (shown on the larger map and still within the park boundaries) (30 km for runners)</p>
		<p>If you want to see runners at the <span>finish line</span>, you need to drive around to Sasamat Lake, which is about a 15 minute drive away from Buntzen Lake. Sasamat Lake is shown on the small blue map on the brochure. It is not labelled but the road names are labelled. Sasamat is the small circular lake just southwest of Buntzen on that map.</p>
